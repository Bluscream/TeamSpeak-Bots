Disclaimer! <br><br>

Most Scripts/Bots where uploaded Tested, yet I do not guarantee it being fail-safe or safe for use and will only provide<br> partially support.<br><br>

<b>It is recommended, that you put the "TeamSpeak3" directory in your own, personal library.<br>
For example /var/libraries/. Don't forget to change the path in config.php<br>
This will save space and makes it easier to update it for all scripts.</b>
